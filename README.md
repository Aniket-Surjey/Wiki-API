# Wiki-API
This Repository contains short description related to the web development tools and technologies that i learned and you can do various operations on that like Read, Update, Delete and Create (All CRUD Operations).
I have used only backend (server) to manipulate operations on database (MongoDB).
For Create (POST) and for updating (PUT and PATCH) the Article i have used Postman.
